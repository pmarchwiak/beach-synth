"wave queen"

a water god makes waves 

hw2 for [the musical web](https://sfpc.study/sessions/summer-24/musical-web) at the [school for poetic computation](https://sfpc.study)

this piece was inspired by the book 
[waves and beaches](https://www.patagonia.com/stories/the-return-of-a-surf-classic/story-96353.html), 
which had me thinking about the relationship between ocean waves and sound waves.
